        <p>Welcome to AMP Report, where we're transforming the landscape of property investment intelligence through cutting-edge database architecture and data-driven cost analysis.</p>

        <h3>üéØ Our Mission</h3>
        <p>The real estate investment industry has long relied on outdated methods for property renovation cost analysis. What traditionally takes consultants weeks of manual work, we're making possible in minutes through sophisticated algorithms and market-validated data.</p>

        <h3>üèóÔ∏è Technical Foundation</h3>
        <p>Our platform is built on a robust, multi-tenant database architecture designed to scale from individual property analysis to enterprise portfolio management. We've developed multiple schema options to balance complexity, features, and implementation strategy:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Schema Option A:</strong> Comprehensive multi-tenant architecture with advanced portfolio management</li>
            <li><strong>Schema Option B:</strong> Immutable, geo-intelligent design focused on data integrity</li>
            <li><strong>Schema Option C:</strong> Performance-optimized design for rapid development</li>
            <li><strong>Merged Schema:</strong> Ultimate synthesis combining the best of all approaches</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üöÄ What's Next</h3>
        <p>We're continuously evolving our platform to meet the growing demands of real estate professionals. Stay tuned for updates on our development progress, technical insights, and industry analysis.</p>
